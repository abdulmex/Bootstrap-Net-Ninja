This repository contains all that i have learnt so far in Bootstrap.
The directory "Bootstrap5" contains an eBook website that i coded along from the NetNinja bootstrap tutorial, while the other "Bootstrap5 Notes" contains all the notes, little practices i did for each topic in the tutorial, it was fun all along using Bootstrap.
